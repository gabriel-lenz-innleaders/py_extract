## Backend
- **app.py**: The main application file for the backend, containing the server logic, route definitions, and request handling.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies required for the backend application.

## Frontend
- **index.html**: The main HTML file for the frontend, serving as the entry point for the web application with links to stylesheets and scripts.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd meu-projeto
   ```
3. Install backend dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```
4. Start the backend server:
   ```
   python backend/app.py
   ```
5. Open `frontend/index.html` in a web browser to view the application.

## Usage Guidelines
- Ensure that the backend server is running before accessing the frontend.
- Modify the backend logic in `app.py` as needed to handle different routes and requests.
- Update the `index.html` file to change the frontend layout and design.
